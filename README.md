# Ponyo

Ponyo is a high-level comphrensive library for Standard ML. It is the first
such implementation in Standard ML and addresses some of the gaps found in
a standard that has seen little revision in almost 20 years. In particular,
the needs of PL researchers and the average programmer interested in ML
are different. Ponyo's take on a comprehensive library will be geared toward
use on the server as a scripting language and for server-side web development.
